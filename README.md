# **HMMs and Viterbi algorithm for POS tagging**
Modify the Viterbi algorithm to solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques.

- Write the vanilla Viterbi algorithm for assigning POS tags (i.e. without dealing with unknown words) 
- Solve the problem of unknown words using at least two techniques. These techniques can use any of the approaches discussed in the class - lexicon, rule-based, probabilistic etc. 
- Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the vanilla Viterbi algorithm.
- List down at least three cases from the sample test file (i.e. unknown word-tag pairs) which were incorrectly tagged by the original Viterbi POS tagger and got corrected after your modifications.
